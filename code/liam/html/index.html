            <h3>Let's hang, Portland.</h3>
            <p>Jammed is the new go-to for catching the latest in local music. We have shows almost every night,
                head on over to the SHOWS tab to check out what's next. Want to show off your own stuff?
            Thursday nights are open mic. Get up there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Hungry? We've got you covered. Check out the options. Call in ahead if you can't wait to eat.
                Local brews rotate weekly. Leftover tabs at the end of the night are subject to a 20% gratuity.
