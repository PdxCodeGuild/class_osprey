# Lab 12: Automated Tests

Write automated tests that run with `pytest` for the following labs:
* Pick 6
* ATM

Each function should have its own set of tests, and each set of tests should have multiple assertions. Test all of the edge cases you can think of, but keep individual assertions small. 

If you need to refactor your code to make it more testable, include the refactored code in your pull request.

To run pytest, first `pip install pytest` and then in your terminal run `pytest path/to/your/test/file.py`
