## Student Presentations

At the end of the Python and JavaScript sections, you'll give a presentation on a "mini capstone" of your choice. This is practice for your capstone presentation which you'll give on the last day of class.

These presentations help you practice communicating technical topics in English. Being able to speak intelligently about programming is almost as important as programming itself. This skill will allow you to better talk to interviewers, managers, clients, coworkers, and more.

In all three presentations, you should first explain the development process and the different parts of your code. Then run the application and show its features and interaction (entering data, seeing results, etc). Here are some questions to contemplate while planning out your presentation:

- what problem does your application solve? what is the core function it performs?
- how did you go about planning?
- what major issues did you encounter during the course of development? how did you go about overcoming them?
- how did your vision for the project change over time?
- what part did you like the most? least?
- what is the future of the project? what features (if any) will you work on next?

## Getting Unstuck

- Write pseudocode in English
- Add comments to explain your process to yourself
- Use functions to "black box" pieces of code
- Break code into logical bits
- Only do one thing at a time
- Don't do too much on one line
- There's no such thing as too many `print()`s
